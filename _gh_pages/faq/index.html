			<dt class="expandable">
				<span>Q: We heard a loud bang in the garage and cannot open the garage door. What happened?</span>
			</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>It is very highly likely that you have a broken spring that should be replaced by an experienced and qualified garage door service technician. If your springs (torsion springs) stretch along the track on the sides you will find that they are very obviously in two separate pieces. It is recommended that you replace both springs if only one is broken since they both have the same wear and tear.</p>

			<dt class="expandable">
				<span>Q: While we were closing the garage door something caused the door to stop halfway and now the door is hanging crooked in the opening. What is wrong with the door?</span>
			</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>Most likely one of the garage door cables has come off of the cable drum (side that is hanging the lowest) from closing on something. The cables may still be under spring tension and should not be touched without the proper knowledge and tools to make the repair. In addition, trying to force the garage closed or open may cause further damage to the garage door tracks and may also cause the door to fall to the floor. In most cases you are better off to leave the door in whatever positon it is in until it can be properly repaired.</p>

			<!-- FAQ 3-->
			<dt class="expandable">
				<span>Q: Why does the garage door reverse and open when I try to close it?</span>
			</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>The likely culprit is an obstruction in the path of the door. Check for and clear any obstruction in the path of the door. If the problem persists, check to see if the red safety beam LED indicator is blinking. If it is, check to be sure that the lenses are mounted 6″ from the floor on either side of the garage door opening. If the safety beam lenses appear to be installed properly, refer to the troubleshooting section of the owner’s manual for additional causes and solutions.</p>

			<!-- FAQ 4-->
			<dt class="expandable">
				<span>Q: Why is the opener running but the door isn’t moving?</span>
			</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>The door may be disengaged. Check to be sure that the red emergency release cord hasn’t been pulled. If this is the culprit, re-engage the carriage. How to re-engage the carriage depends on the model. See your owner’s manual for more details.</p>

			<!-- FAQ 5-->
			<dt class="expandable">
				<span>Q: Why won’t my garage door open when I press the button?</span>
			</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>Does the opener have electric power? Plug a lamp into the outlet the opener is plugged into. If it doesn't light, check the fuse box or the circuit breaker. Keep in mind that a wall switch may control some outlets. If there is power to the operator then there is some type of mechanical or electrical problem within the garage door opener itself and may need to be diagnosed by a qualified service technician. Have you disabled all locks on the garage door? Is there a build-up of ice or snow under the door? The door may be frozen to the ground.</p>
				<p>Pull the emergency release cable and try to manually lift the door. If the garage door does not lift, the door springs may be broken. Call us to replace or adjust the springs. NOTE: Repeated operation may have tripped the overload protector in the motor. Wait 15 minutes and try again.</p>

			<!-- FAQ 6-->
			<dt class="expandable">
				<span>Q: Why do I have to hold the wall button in to get the opener to close?</span>
			</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>It sounds like the photo-cell safety beams are blocked, misaligned, or malfunctioning. Move any objects that may be interfering with the signal and verify that the photo-cell LED lights are illuminated as per the manufacturer's instructions. If the infrared beams are not blocked and the photo-cells appear that they are aligned, you will want to have an experience service technician diagnose and repair the problem. You will not be able to close the door with the remote control transmitter until the photo-cells are in proper working order.</p>
			</dd>
			<!-- FAQ 6-->
			<!-- FAQ 7-->
			<dt class="expandable">
				<span>Q: Why won't the remote work?</span>
			</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>First of all make sure that the opener works from the wall button, if it does check to see if it's just one remote control or all of the remote controls. If it's just one remote control check the code on that remote. Next check if the indicator light on your remote control is solid or bright. If not, replace the battery. If none of the remote controls are working, make sure that all of the remote controls are coded into the receiver. If you have made all of the preceding checks it can usually be presumed that the receiver is bad and an experienced service technician should be able to easily diagnose and repair the problem or advise on a new opener.</p>
